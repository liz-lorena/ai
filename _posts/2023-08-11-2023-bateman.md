excerpt: "While on vacation in Cuba this year, I read the hilarious and disturbing horror dark comedy novel _American Psycho_ by Bret Easton Ellis. It's probably now my favorite book of all time. I got attached to Patrick Bateman and had to draw him as a wolf in a suit because that's what he is. Pay no mind to the poorly drawn attire as I had no internet and couldn't look up any references LMAO"
