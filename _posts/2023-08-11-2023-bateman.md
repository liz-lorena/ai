excerpt: "While on vacation in Cuba this year, I read the hilarious and disturbing horror dark comedy novel American Psycho by Bret Easton Ellis. It's probably now my favorite book of all time. I got attached to Patrick Bateman and had to draw him as a wolf in a suit because that's what he is. I tried making him look "generic" yet conventionally attractive, and he ended up looking sort of like Ted Bundy, which is appropriate. If I were to redraw this or draw him as a human I would of course make him tan, give him amber eyes, and probably thinner eyebrows. Pay no mind to the poorly drawn attire as I had no internet and couldn't look up any references LMAO"
